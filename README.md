### Battery Level

##### Backstory


    I work exclusively on laptops now. I actually haven't even owned a desktop machine in the last 15 years

    I (currently) have a Macbook Air, Macbook Pro and Toshiba Ultrabook (Running Kali), but my work machine
    is and has been a Macbook Pro for the last few years (Thanks Karen, you finally got me...). I work from
    coffeeshops, meetings or just plain on the go often, so itâ€™s nice to have a reminder of my remaining
    battery power to know when I need to plug in.

  * Blink on Red / Low
